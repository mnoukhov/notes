# FWSY Sourdough

## 2020/04/22

### mixing
342g white
13g whole wheat
25g rye
300g water
- firm, less sticky dough
- maybe too dry

autolyse 30m

11g salt
115g starter

### prep
3 folds 30min apart

12 hour rise, 2-3x size
- fit perfectly in brown bowl with shower cap

3.5 hour proof
- possibly underproofed?
slight issue with inversion
- much more flour in proofing basket helped tremendously
- still stuck to basket around base, add more flour?


515 preheat with pot
slight issue with putting in pot
- switch back to BA parchment paper trick

30 min covered
- oven spring not significant enough?
25 min uncovered
- dark gold, light brown colour
- could be longer


### result
Dense bread, still not enough rise
- check if starter is active, add more?
- proof longer 4-4.5 hours? fridge time helped previously

Good colour but could be darker
- even hotter oven temp?

Nicer pattern but not controlled
- issues with inversion 
- too long between inversion and baking 
- doesn't hold shape well enough?

### next time
- check starter activity
- make dough slightly wetter
- proof longer, maybe in fridge
- use more flour in proofing basket
- use parchment paper trick
